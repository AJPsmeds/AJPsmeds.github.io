<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400">The universe the Flash lives in uses a timeline theory called the usurped timeline theory. This basically means when someone goes back in time, the string that represents the timeline is snipped and a copy of that timeline is made. The world then goes on as if the other timeline never existed. It still does somewhere in the universe, but it can never be accessed by the outside again.When someone goes forward in time, the timeline creates what would have happened if the traveler did not change the past with info from the future, but the second the time traveler goes back to the time he was originally in, it all disappears giving him an idea of what will happen and what they need to change.</p> <!__Body__>

<br /> <h2 style="text-align:center">Alternate Timelines and How They Work</h2> 
<img src="PivitolChange.png" style="float:left" alt="Pivitol Change" width="400" height="200"> 
<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400">The Flash deals with many examples of mistakes that time travelers can make and the consequences of accidental time travel, but the best example is Flashpoint. Flashpoint is an alternate timeline created by the Flash that changes almost everything about his world. It also gives us a view into what would happen when pivotal changes are made to the timeline. It tells us that the time traveler starts to become a permanent resident in the timeline after a couple of months. They start to lose memory, talents, personality traits, and in a meta-human’s case, their genetic modification. A meta-human is a genetically modified human. </p><!__Body__>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400">According to Einstein's theory of special relativity, approaching the speed of light would slow time, traveling at the speed of light would make time stand still and traveling faster than the speed of light would reverse time. So, when speed is increased, time moves slower and someone would be able to age slower and live into the future. There have been many experiments that prove this on a miniscule scale.<p/> 
<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400"> Example To the left: Pic. 4 <i>Carol Allie’s Experiment</i> </p>
<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400">So, scientists decided on a theoretical way to “travel forward” in time, or live longer so you could see the future. By traveling in a spaceship at about four hundred and fifty million miles per hour, passengers would feel a significant slow in time. The slowed time would not be noticeable to the traveler, but once the traveler returned, he'd find that those who remained on Earth had aged at a faster rate.</p> <!__Body__>

<img style="float:left" src="Wormhole.png" alt="Wormhole" width="400" height="400">  
<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400">The concept of traveling back in time is a bit trickier. Einstein showed that traveling at or faster than the speed of light is impossible, because the force necessary to propel at these speeds becomes so high, close to infinity in fact. Although some think there may be a way to find "shortcuts" to the past. Kip Thorne of the University of California at Berkeley suggested that wormholes exist in space. These are essentially two connecting black holes whose mouths make up a tear in the fabric of space-time. By stretching a wormhole until it’s mouths are light years away from each other, you could got to the future or past.<br /><br />Pic. 5 <i>Wormhole</i></p> <!__Body__>
<br /> <h2 style="text-align:center">Anayisis</h2> 
<p style="text-align:center;margin-right:400; margin-left:400">The concept of having a man run fast enough to time travel, in itself is not possible. The closest you can come is having Usain Bolt on amphetamine, which surprisingly can make you faster. It would still not be close to the four hundred and fifty million miles per hour that is needed to slow time enough to live to the future and traveling back in time is almost impossible. In the Flash it also takes more speed to go forward than backward, which we know not to be true. So, the Flash is not exactly up to date when it comes to time travel.</p> <!__Body__>
